This repository contains phenomenological models for transport properties in superconducting systems, including vortex dynamics. The focus is on the temperature and field dependence of transport-related quantities, such as resistance, voltage–current characteristics, critical current behavior, and non-equilibrium effects like the Larkin–Ovchinnikov instability, as well as phase diagrams.
